# A bioinformatics analysis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease

This was my midterm project of the class 20.260 Computational Analysis of Biological Data I took at MIT in Spring 2024. For our midterm project, we were tasked to use the dataset of a recently published paper and apply new computational approaches to extract new, biologically significant hypotheses that the authors had not reached. I chose to read the paper [*Modelling human liver fibrosis in the context of
non-alcoholic steatohepatitis using a microphysiological system*](https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-021-02616-x) by Kostrzewski et al.

I was excited to apply differential expression analysis on bulk-RNA seq data, as well as gene set enrichment analysis, to give a high level overview of the transcriptomic profile of different NAFLD patient samples. For an in-depth writeup and figures, please view the PDF in this repo. I used R for DESeq and GSEA and Python for heatmap clustering.
